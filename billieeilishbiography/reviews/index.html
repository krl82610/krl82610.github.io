        fearless approach to self-expression. It’s an inspiring read that gives
        you a real sense of Billie’s world—her struggles, triumphs, and

        which was a fascinating part of her story. This isn’t just a book about
        a singer—it’s a story of resilience, authenticity, and ambition that
